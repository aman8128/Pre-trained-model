Perfect, Mr. Stark üí° ‚Äî **Phase 1: Code Assist Mode** is a smart and solid first move.

Let‚Äôs define this phase clearly so we build something powerful and modular from Day 1.

### üí• **Cvu Phase 1: Code Assist AI (Local Dev Focused)**

#### üéØ **Core Goal:**
> Make Cvu behave like a smart dev assistant ‚Äî giving contextual **code suggestions, completions, explanations, and small refactors**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Phase 1 Milestones**
Here‚Äôs a clean breakdown for Phase 1:

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Local API + Completion Engine**
- [x] `Uvicorn FastAPI Server` ‚Äì ‚úÖ you're already running it
- [ ] Code completion endpoint `/complete`
- [ ] Code explanation endpoint `/explain`
- [ ] Refactor suggestion endpoint `/refactor`

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Tokenizer & Embedding Pipeline**
- [ ] Setup local tokenizer (HF-compatible or custom BPE)
- [ ] Context handling logic (truncation, chunking, etc.)
- [ ] Prompt builder ‚Üí `[SYSTEM + USER + CODE_CONTEXT]`

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ VS Code Extension (Frontend for Cvu)**
- [ ] Localhost connection to API (fetch suggestions from `/complete`)
- [ ] Highlight-based request trigger (on selection / keystroke)
- [ ] UI panel for Cvu suggestions (like Copilot ghost text)
- [ ] Optional: Button ‚Üí ‚ÄúExplain this code‚Äù ‚Üí call `/explain`

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Integration**
- [ ] Use a **local code-focused model** (e.g., `codegemma`, `starcoder`, `phi`, `codellama`, etc.)
- [ ] Memory handling (you already have 8GB, so <1.5B models ideal for now)

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt Template System**
- [ ] Custom templates per feature:
    - Completion: `Complete the following code:\n<code_snippet>`
    - Explanation: `Explain what this code does:\n<code_snippet>`
    - Refactor: `Improve this code:\n<code_snippet>`

### üì¶ Suggested Model (Phase 1 - Light)
| Model | Params | Good For | RAM Fit? |
|-------|--------|----------|-----------|
| `codellama-7b-instruct` | 7B | Great completions | ‚ùå Heavy |
| `codegemma-1.1b` | 1.1B | Lightweight + fast | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `StarCoderBase-1B` | 1B | Code gen | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `phi-2` | 2.7B | General assist | ‚ö†Ô∏è Borderline |

### üî• Bonus Ideas (optional in Phase 1)
- Command line interface (CLI) version of Cvu
- File-aware code suggestion (`send file path + cursor position`)
- Smart completion based on current file type
